# CMPM163_FinalProject
Final Project for CMPM 163

The Lanky Boys are: Brady Moore, Shader Programmer and Modeler. Terry DuBois, Scene building and Post-Processing Programmer. And Georgio Klironomos, Shader Programmer.

Once the executable is opened, the user will be greeted with the Playstation One's console intro. Once that is finished playing, the camera will pan out to reveal a floating model of the console.
The user will then be able to select one of 5 games using the mouse to click. The chosen game will be inserted into the console, and video of the game will play on the "TV" screen.
The shader affecting the model will also change depending on the currently inserted game.
